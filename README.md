I am Seyed-Ahmad Ahmadi (@nvahmadi), senior solution architect at Nvidia, for healthcare accounts in the EMEA region. 

I am interested in applied machine & deep learning in medicine, especially its translation into clinical environments. My specialties are deep models for image analysis (applied through frameworks like [MONAI](https://monai.io/) or [Clara Medical Imaging](https://developer.nvidia.com/clara-medical-imaging)), and [Geometric Deep Learning](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/) im medical imaging and patient population analyses.
