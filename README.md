I am Seyed-Ahmad Ahmadi (@nvahmadi), Senior Solution Architect at NVIDIA, for healthcare and life sciences accounts in the EMEA region. 

I am interested in applied machine & deep learning in medicine, especially its translation into clinical environments. My specialties are deep models for image analysis (applied through frameworks like [MONAI](https://monai.io/)), and [Geometric Deep Learning](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/) in medical imaging and patient population analyses. 

If you are interested in my publications, please have a look at my Google Scholar [profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xqGgWvQAAAAJ&hl=en).
