I am Seyed-Ahmad Ahmadi (@nvahmadi), Senior Solution Architect at NVIDIA, for healthcare and life sciences accounts in the EMEA region. 

I am interested in applied machine & deep learning in medicine, especially its translation into clinical environments. More generally, I am interested in using and combining various data types in the healthcare domain and beyond:
* **Tabular data:** mixed-type structured data in the wild (incl noisy and missing features). Preferred tools: NVIDIA's accelerated data science library [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/), which offers GPU-accelerated versions of:
    * [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf), a fast version of the most popular features of pandas, sharing the same API
    * [cuML](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml), a fast version of the most popular models and methods in scikit-learn, sharing the same API
    * [cuGraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph), a fast version of the most popular models and methods in networkX, sharing the same API
* **Grid data:** in 1D/2D/3D, mostly in the domain of medical image analysis. Preferred tool: [MONAI](https://monai.io/).
* **Text/language data:** NLP using LLMs and RAG agents for retrieval from knowledge bases. Preferred tool: [NeMo Framework](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/generative-ai/nemo-framework/)
* **Graph data**: graph analytics and graph neural nets (GNNs)/[Geometric Deep Learning](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/). Preferred tool: PyG, via our [PyG containers on NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pyg).

My main interest is to use deep learning for multimodal fusion of above data types, on healthcare data (multi-omics fustion), and other domains.
